# Lines starting with '#' are comments.
# Each line is a file pattern followed by one or more owners,
# Global owners need to be listed first, example - * @account1 @account2
# After global, order is important, the last matching pattern per folder has the most precedence

# All up code owners - this should be limited to a select few - if specific code owner is needed, add to the specific folders below
